Tutorial
-----------------
::

    to start working (message content is not important)
    >>> tf log "Arrived."

    to save a timestamp and your log message,
    when finished doing a task write
    >>> tf log "Timeflow: create README.rst"

    here 'Timeflow' is a 'project' you were working on and 'create README.rst'
    is a log of what you were exactly doing this time. Both project and log
    must be separated by a colon and space (``: ``).

    some tasks are not (payable) work, mark them with two asterisks (**)
    >>> tf log "Slack: chatting in the office ** "

    you can have 'projects' without any explanations
    >>> tf log "Lunch ** "
    >>> tf log "Daily Scrum"

    if you made a mistake, or missed to log of your activities
    you can edit like this
    >>> tf edit

    this way timeflow will try to run your editor set in $EDITOR
    or you can try
    >>> tf edit -e vim

    to open log file in vim

    to check how much you've worked today
    >>> tf stats

    or to make a report
    >>> tf stats --report

    you can pass date ranges for stats command, e.g.
    >>> tf stats --from 2015-01-01 --to 2015-01-31
    >>> tf stats --from 2015-01-01 --to 2015-01-31 --report
